# Second-Challenge

## Description

The aim of creating this repository is to create my first professional portfolio. With this first portfolio I can share my coding projects and will be updated with my progress. Through this project I put in practice the lessons in HTML and CSS, from coding from scratch to flexboxes, this challenge was definitely a challenge. After completing this initial stage of the project I feel more confident in my skills but it also showed me I still got a lot to learn and a lot to improve. I hope I can look back at this after completing the bootcamp and see how much I have impoved
